# Crud-Operations
It is a simple application which performs crud operations, with a simple login system without authentication, using node.js and MySQL.

I'm new to programing there are some major mistakes in the code, I know it, but hopefully I'll learn and correct them in the near future.

Some Errors are : 1. Cant View the uploaded Images 2. Login Autentication.

Important : I have stored my database details and port in .env file so create a .env file before anything else.
